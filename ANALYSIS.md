# Dreams: decompilation results and findings

This is the written account behind the status map. The [research data](analysis/research-details.json) records failure addresses, saved signature corrections, proposed names, and matched property fields. [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) contains the applied naming ledger; [MAPPING.md](MAPPING.md) explains the system assignments.

## Current results

| Work | Recorded result |
| --- | --- |
| Function inventory | 9,551 discovered functions |
| Frozen v1 extraction | 9,508 functions with cached C-like pseudocode; 43 failures |
| Applied descriptive names | 30, verified after reopening the project |
| Deferred naming reviews | 4 |
| ReporterTelemetry names | Three applied and verified after reopening |
| System mapping | 1,540 functions associated with nine systems; 8,011 still unclassified |
| Saved signature corrections | Six field-registration helpers; native reopen checks passed |
| Frozen v2 extraction | 9,513 cached outputs; 38 failures; all 9,551 functions accounted for |

These are separate stages. Extracting pseudocode gives us code to inspect. Mapping establishes its association with a part of Dreams. Checking a descriptive name requires evidence for that function's particular role. The status map tracks the applied naming reviews within the mapped inventory.

The pseudocode is generated from machine code. Original source files, original local-variable names, complete class definitions, a complete build, and a working reconstruction of Dreams have not been recovered.

## Executable and calling convention

The supplied analysis is a Windows PE wrapper with embedded `.elf` sections. A sample of 1,664 code bytes matched the PS4 SELF reference using an address mapping offset of `0x140010000`. This establishes the sampled relationship; it is not a whole-binary equivalence proof.

The original Windows calling convention obscured PS4 arguments. A validated `PS4_SYSV` model was applied to 9,486 eligible functions, with 19 thunks inheriting their targets' convention. The frozen v1 snapshot therefore records 9,505 effective assignments. Its 45 existing explicit signatures were initially preserved.

Later work corrected the inputs of these six explicit field-registration helpers:

| Address | Existing function name |
| --- | --- |
| `14010fc00` | `RegisterFloatFieldOffset` |
| `140cd8b00` | `RegisterBooleanFieldOffset` |
| `140cdbb80` | `RegisterTransformFieldOffset` |
| `140cdca90` | `RegisterGadgetNameFieldOffset` |
| `140ceccc0` | `RegisterFloat2FieldOffset` |
| `140d5f6c0` | `RegisterCanvasPropertiesFieldOffset` |

Native instructions and callers establish a registry in RDI, a property key in RSI, and the object's field byte offset in EDX. The saved corrections recover the missing input while preserving the existing offset's meaningful name, width, and EDX storage. Return types were preserved; return contracts still need separate review.

The promotion was tested on a copy, saved to the working project, and checked after reopening through the native Ghidra API. Metadata and selected decompilations matched the recorded post-change state, and all 27 checked names were preserved. The live MCP readback now confirms all six corrected signatures, four caller signatures, body sizes, conventions, and all 27 applied names. All ten MCP decompilations match native Ghidra using the same default options. The other 39 explicit signatures remain deferred.

The newer verified snapshot contains these changes. Its separate v2 initial pass is complete and audited: all 9,551 functions were attempted, 9,490 complete output hashes were verified, and 61 failures were recorded (59 timeouts, one flow-limit failure, and one forced-merge failure). Every address and terminal attempt matched the inventory, and no successful output was re-decompiled. All 59 eligible timeouts received one additional 60-second attempt. The final audit verified 9,513 complete output hashes and 38 failures: 36 timeouts, one flow-limit failure, and one forced-merge failure. It checked all 9,551 inventory addresses, all 9,610 attempt records, and the absence of repeated successful extraction. Both the initial and final failure lists are retained separately. The older v1 cache remains intact. The per-address status now uses v2 extraction and convention data; current naming reviews are joined separately by address. The system-map evidence still comes from unchanged native code in v1. No code outputs from the two cache versions were mixed.

The MCP server uses a default DecompInterface, whereas native cache extraction loads the saved program's decompiler options. Seven of ten sampled outputs differed between these configurations, including whether constant data was folded into literal values. All ten outputs matched exactly when native Ghidra used the MCP defaults. This is an options comparison, not evidence of a program change or additional semantic-review progress. Original archive, imported-copy, and SELF-reference hashes were rechecked unchanged.

Global Windows data organization has not been replaced. SIMD arguments, indirect callbacks, return contracts, native type sizes, and complete layouts still need checking against instructions.

## How Dreams describes object properties

The inspected code contains explicit type descriptors, field-registration routines, and visitors that access the same fields at matching object offsets. Those links let us distinguish an object's properties from the algorithms that implement its behavior.

Several visitors are shared between many object types:

| Shared property type | Established observations |
| --- | --- |
| Pos | The helper visits transform and legacy physics data. Calculator uses it at `+0x40`; many other objects use it too. Its role is broader than a position vector. |
| CanvasProperties | Calculator's TweakProps at `+0x90` matches an explicitly named descriptor with a `0x40` field extent. The visitor handles canvas transforms, bounds, and packed data. |
| Variant | Calculator OperandA and OperandB at `+0xd8` and `+0x100` match an explicit Variant descriptor with a `0x28` extent. The visitor uses a tag at `+0x24` and alpha at `+0x20`. Tag meanings and the full union layout remain unresolved. |
| GadgetName | Calculator's Name at `+0x128` matches an explicit GadgetName descriptor with an eight-byte field extent. Its encoding remains unresolved; it is not established as a raw string pointer. |

The confirmed gadget clusters include:

| Cluster | Evidence and useful distinctions |
| --- | --- |
| Calculator | Distinct OperandA, OperandB, and Name fields link its visitor to the shared Variant and GadgetName registration helpers. |
| Splitter | InputA at `+0xd8`, Name at `+0x100`, and RotationRepresentation at `+0x108` distinguish its layout from Combiner. |
| Combiner | Nine field registrations match the visitor, including FatWireType at `+0xd1`, Name at `+0xd8`, and RotationRepresentation at `+0xe0`. Two labels are supplied by specialized helpers rather than direct literal arguments. |
| MagicDoor | All 23 registered fields match the visitor. Distinctive fields include MagicDoorType at `+0x119`, MagicDoorOpenUI at `+0x124`, and MagicDoorUseSpawnTrans at `+0x151`. |
| SignalInspector | All 16 fields match. InputA is at `+0x118`; TimeSinceChange and BrightnessOnChange use byte accesses at `+0x140` and `+0x141`. Their labels alone do not establish floating-point types or time units. |
| SignalGenerator | All 14 fields match, including SweepSeconds at `+0xd8`, PauseSeconds at `+0xe0`, OutputNormalised at `+0xec`, RandomTime at `+0x108`, and RandomMag at `+0x110`. |
| CameraShaker | Eleven field labels and offsets match between registration and visitation. |
| PadRumble | Thirteen field labels and offsets match between registration and visitation. |

The [research data](analysis/research-details.json) includes all 77 matched fields from the MagicDoor, SignalInspector, SignalGenerator, CameraShaker, and PadRumble reviews. These observations support the applied function names. They do not establish complete object layouts, serialization direction, version-gate meanings, or the runtime camera-shake and rumble algorithms.

## Object types and system mapping

The game's object-type enum registers numeric identities. Matching those values to the native 120-entry property-dispatch jump table resolved every branch. Of those branches, 119 have a system classification; the legacy Key case remains unclassified.

Examples include Sculpt at tag `1`, SignalInspector at `0x4a`, PuppetControls at `0x57`, and ReporterTelemetry at `0x51`. Exact dispatch links resolve cases where different object types share field names. Source-file references also associate code with CSG, sprite processing, rendering, collision, the editor UI, and Dreamiverse pages.

The complete per-address assignments and evidence are in [system-map.json](analysis/system-map.json). These associations are incomplete research classifications. They do not establish the complete size or complexity of each game system.

## ReporterTelemetry: applied descriptive names

| Address | Applied name | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1404de8c0` | `VisitReporterTelemetryProperties` | Applied; verified after reopening |
| `140d6c700` | `RegisterReporterTelemetryFieldOffsets` | Applied; verified after reopening |
| `140d580d0` | `RegisterReporterTelemetryTypeDescriptor` | Applied; verified after reopening |

An exact ReporterTelemetry literal is installed on descriptor `1458afdd0`. The initializer links the Thing base descriptor and transfers to the field registrar. All 14 registered fields match the independently inspected visitor, including six TelemetryKey fields at `+0xe0` through `+0x108`, and TimeSinceSend at `+0x110`. Dispatcher tag `0x51` corroborates the identity.

The extension fields are guarded by a visitor-state value of at least `0x1869f` (99,999), with additional filtering conditions. The meaning and normal reachability of that threshold are unresolved. This review establishes property roles; it does not establish transmission behavior, recipients, payloads, or a reporting algorithm. The three descriptive names were applied with reversible journals and a cold backup, then verified after reopening. A subsequent immutable reopen audit compared all 9,551 functions against v2 plus those three approved name changes, including signatures, parameter/local metadata, bodies, and comments. Types, external functions, memory, block permissions, and symbols also matched; symbol names and sources were normalized only for the three approved renames. A closed checkpoint copy passed byte-for-byte verification. They bring the applied-name total to 30. The frozen v2 extraction still uses its earlier 27-name snapshot; no cached output or snapshot was rewritten.

## Extraction failures and experiments

The frozen cache has 41 timeouts, one flow-limit failure at `1401180e0`, and one forced-merge failure at `14146b220`. Every failed address, body size, and attempt count is listed in [research-details.json](analysis/research-details.json).

For `1401180e0`, a disposable-copy experiment expanded the analyzed body and supplied candidate switch references. It produced pseudocode successfully. Fifty table entries had local targets, but the byte selector permits values up to 255 and no explicit upper-bound guard was established. The legal selector domain therefore remains uncertain. The experiment was rolled back and was not promoted as a production fix; the frozen failure count remains 43.

For `14146b220`, normalization succeeded and exposed intermediate control-flow information. That mode does not produce extracted C. A separate full-decompilation attempt with array splitting disabled still failed with the forced-merge intersection error and produced no C output. Both experiments left the production cache unchanged.

The final v2 mechanical scan inspected all 9,513 cached outputs. It flagged 5,919 functions with decompiler warnings, 230 with unresolved register inputs, 367 with unresolved SIMD call outputs, 90 with invalid or unimplemented flow patterns, and 1,292 with an indirect-call pattern. These categories overlap; a flag is a review lead, and no flag does not prove correctness. Every discovered address has a local scan or failure record and a next step. This adds no semantic-review credit.

An earlier mechanical quality scan inspected 9,482 v1 outputs while extraction was still in progress. It flagged warnings, indirect calls, unresolved register inputs, and SIMD-call outputs as review leads. Its counts are not a final audit of all 9,508 cached outputs and are not semantic-review credit. The completed extraction integrity audit separately checked all 9,508 cached file hashes and the full 9,551-address inventory.

## Remaining work

Extraction and accounting for the current inventory are complete. Research remains partial: 38 extraction failures need targeted investigation, 39 explicit signatures remain deferred, 4 naming reviews remain unresolved, and 9,517 functions have no completed semantic naming review. The next research work is to investigate those failures, validate deferred signatures, extend the code-to-system map, and review the functions within those systems. Further proposed names must be applied and checked after reopening before they receive applied-name credit. Full signatures, layouts, and algorithms need their own evidence.

The public files contain findings and structural evidence. Raw pseudocode, binary inputs, Ghidra projects, and unfiltered local reports are retained separately. That separation does not reduce the extraction counts or mean the locally saved work was undone.

## Continued semantic review: wireless and variables

Eleven more descriptive names were applied and survived a clean saved-project reopening: **41 names checked; 4 deferred; 9,506 still unreviewed**. The original archive and input copy hashes remain unchanged. This is ongoing reverse engineering; successful extraction does not complete it.

- WirelessReceiver and WirelessTransmitter: their literal type names identify separate descriptors. Each initializer links the Thing base descriptor and invokes its own field registrar. The visitors match all 16 receiver and 12 transmitter object offsets. Receiver-specific ZoneSize, ZoneOffset, FalloffSize, FalloffOffset and DetectName distinguish it from the transmitter, which has DetectScope. These are property visitors, not identified wireless signal-processing algorithms.
- VariableGadget: the descriptor, registrar and visitor agree on 20 field offsets. Explicit fields include InitialValue (+0xe8), IsMultiplayer (+0x108), IsPersistentInMap (+0x109), ForceResetVariable (+0x10a), VariableValueShouldBePreserved (+0x10f), and RestoreVariableOnLevelRewind (+0x110). Three nested fields use shared helpers without outer labels; their exact helper roles remain unresolved. The last two flags are gated by visitor state +0x1c >= 0x5ff. Actual variable update, persistence and rewind behavior still need tracing.
- ReporterSculpt: only its type-descriptor initializer and six-field registrar were named. The generic neighboring visitor is still unassigned because the type identity is not proven by adjacency.

Every new function was read as cached v2 C and checked against complete assembly and direct literal reads. Changes are names only, journaled with old names, backed up before application and verified against the complete 9,551-function inventory after reopening. No new extraction run or prototype changes were needed.

### Developer coding streams: research leads

[Media Molecule's programming-stream announcement](https://www.mediamolecule.com/blog/article/this_weeks_live_stream_the_tech_behind_the_magic) identifies Alex Evans and Mark Zarb-Adami demonstrating live code and particle features in April 2016. The official recording is [Dreams PS4 - The Tech Behind The Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZM_Ij9aeOA), whose description identifies wave-shader work. The recording has been located, but its frames and transcript have not yet been analyzed; it supports no function rename in this batch. Pre-release examples must be matched against this executable before treating them as implementation evidence.

Next: inspect source visible in the developer recordings, trace the wireless/variable runtime callers and nested helpers, and continue mapping verified functions to Dreams systems. Metadata registration and property visitation are only part of those systems.

## Player values and boolean player masks

Four additional descriptive names persisted after clean saved-project reopening: **45 verified names, 4 deferred, 9,502 unreviewed**. The full address/name inventory matches the baseline plus the durable rename journal; original input archive hashes are unchanged. Names-only edits were made after a cold project backup.

- `1404f9650` â€” `VisitPlayerValueProperties`: matches the explicit PlayerValue descriptor's `non_player` float at +0 and `values` at +4. Assembly visits four player floats at +4, +8, +0xc and +0x10. Modern state >=0x4ef enters a nested values scope and restores the caller's path state. The older branch instead emits legacy indexed callbacks and `valid_bits=0`. The observed state fields are not yet a recovered version enum.
- `1404f9b20` â€” `VisitPlayerValueBoolProperties`: consumes the caller's low input byte and visits `PlayerBits` through vtable+0x848. Under state +0x18 ==0 and +0x1c <=0x4ee it can also emit `valid_bits=0`. The final indirect jump is a tail callback; the decompiler's switch-table warning is not evidence of an actual switch table.
- `140d68880` â€” `RegisterPlayerValueBoolFieldOffset`: appends a field record and installs the PlayerValueBool descriptor, preserving registry/property-key/object-offset inputs from RDI/RSI/EDX.
- `140d1b1c0` â€” `RegisterPlayerValueBoolTypeDescriptor`: explicitly installs the `PlayerValueBool` literal on descriptor14586d650 and registers `PlayerBits` at byte offset0.

VariableGadget uses these helpers for VariableValue+0xf4 and its increase/decrease bytes at +0x10b/+0x10c. This establishes their property representation; the runtime update algorithms remain to be traced. Full assembly, direct NUL-terminated literal reads, cached C hashes, caller references and after-reopen names are recorded locally. No parameter or type guesses were applied.

### Coding-stream evidence now inspected

The official [Liam Live Codes Dreams recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvGbhvZsTa8&t=1240s) was identified from Media Molecule channel metadata. Auto-captions were searched and a full-resolution source frame around 20:41 was inspected. It shows `physics_tool.cpp`, the signature `PhysicsTool::Update(SController* controller)`, a local `ThingPtr`, and a call to `GetHoveredThing(controller)`. These provide search leads for editor tools and object handles, not proven names for this later executable. The inclusion of `twitch_livecoding.h` also shows that some helpers belong to the demonstration setup. No names in this batch depend on the video. Next, cross-check relevant type and string references before claiming a binary match.

## Editor tool-name lookup

**46 names verified after reopening, 4 deferred, 9,501 unreviewed.** A cold backup preceded the names-only edit; the complete address/name inventory matches the baseline plus the rename journal, and original input archive hashes are unchanged.

`140646860` is now `GetToolTagName`. Its complete 687-instruction assembly and five directly read relative jump tables establish an integer-to-static-name lookup. Static interpretation covers all 837 IDs from 0 through 0x344: 326 named entries and 511 `notag` results. Two out-of-range representatives also return `notag`. A direct caller uses the resulting string under `tool_tag`; another compares it against input text. This establishes editor tag naming, not how the tools execute during gameplay. Object-type IDs and inventory tool-tag IDs are separate enums and must not be confused when tracing gadgets.

REA 6.4.0 was installed in an isolated local folder and tested. Its Ghidra prerequisites pass, but actual inspect requests reject both the Dreams Ghidra archive and original PS4 executable as unsupported formats. Its current Windows provider cannot attach to this saved analysis. Existing Ghidra analysis continues; no REA-generated semantic findings or extra review credit are claimed.

## Variable Gadget defaults

**47 names verified after reopening, 4 deferred, 9,500 unreviewed.** The names-only edit followed a cold backup. The complete inventory matches the baseline plus the durable rename journal; original archives remain unchanged.

`140944f20` is now `InitializeVariableGadgetDefaults`. Two independent caller jump tables route object type 0x58 (VariableGadget) to zero-fill branches followed by this initializer. Complete assembly establishes InitialValue=0, MinLength=-1000, MaxLength=1000, preservation=false and rewind restoration=true, matched to the independently reviewed field registrar. Callers zero the object first; this helper alone does not overwrite every byte.

Runtime investigation also located a value-update function that gates initialization on the preservation flag, consumes linked Variable Modifier objects, clamps values, and constructs increase/decrease masks. That function remains under review: its context gates and caller dispatch need further validation. The extraction count is unchanged and does not represent semantic completion.

## Variable Gadget value update

**48 names verified after reopening, 4 deferred, 9,499 unreviewed.** The names-only edit followed a cold backup and complete function metadata was checked after reopening.

`1408e4bb0` is now `UpdateVariableGadgetValues`. Complete assembly and the caller's directly read jump table confirm type 0x58 dispatch. It gates initialization on the preservation flag, processes linked Variable Modifiers, clamps the five stored values, and produces increase/decrease masks. The modifier's independently registered OperationType enum matches the arithmetic: Set=0, Get=1, Add=2, Reset=3. Get performs no value write in these branches.

Mask bits0..3 correspond to the four player slots and bit4 to the non-player slot; comparisons are strict and ordered. Missing comparison objects leave the masks unchanged. The context double, mode gates, snapshot timing and external player numbering remain unresolved. No guessed types or prototypes were applied, and static analysis is not a claim that gameplay was observed.

## Variable lookup sorting and preservation

**49 names verified after reopening, 4 deferred, 9,498 unreviewed.** `1409af070` is now `SortU64I16Entries`: complete C and assembly review shows lexicographic sorting of 16-byte records by unsigned 64-bit key and signed 16-bit index. Its only non-recursive direct caller builds a Variable Gadget lookup table. The key's semantic identity and original library provenance remain unresolved.

A separately reviewed caller path skips value copying when RestoreVariableOnLevelRewind is enabled. Otherwise it matches Variable Gadgets, copies values, and sets the preservation flag before simulation preparation. Multiplayer values follow player mappings; absent mappings use the destination InitialValue. Raw-byte decoding resolved an incorrect instruction boundary in that caller without altering the project listing. The larger caller is not counted as fully reviewed or newly named.

The name-only change followed a cold backup and full metadata verification after reopening. No guessed types or prototypes were applied. The progress map counts mapped functions only; this generic helper remains unassigned pending system ownership evidence.

## Game-pool context lifecycle

**51 names verified after reopening, 4 deferred, 9,496 unreviewed.** `140904120` is now `InitializeGamePoolContext`; `14090e110` is `AcquireUnusedGamePoolContext`. Complete assembly and the pool-creation sequence establish seven fixed-size contexts, usage counters, exclusion of the current context, and initialization before reuse. The creation code registers the label main game pool and stores the pool in the same global used by acquisition.

Initialization establishes defaults, arena pointers, list anchors and counters; it does more than zero memory. Acquisition waits/retries until a context is available and returns the initialized context through its output pointer. Exact synchronization import identities and full context types remain unresolved. Both edits changed names only, followed a cold backup and were verified with full metadata after reopening.
